schema.dot : a DOT script that was generated from the DB tables.

- You can use the "dot" command from the graphviz package to convert the
  above script into a pdf file

  dot -Tpdf -o schema.pdf schema.dot

schema.pdt : resulting pdf file

Java graphviz API:

https://github.com/eternnoir/graphvizapi

* Note that this API simply provides a way to write in Java the node and 
  connection specifications, but in the end it generates a DOT file and
  runs the system command "dot" to generate the image.

* If you choose not to use this API, you can simply generate the DOT file 
  as a text file, and run the following in your code:

  Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
  ....
  Process p = rt.exec(dot_command_string);

  - see Graphviz.java in the source, the get_img_stream() function.

1. Clone the above repo

2. Install maven to build the repo

     sudo apt install maven
   
   or similar commands depending on your OS

3. Go to the top graphvizapi directory where the pom.xml file is

4. Run maven to build the api

     mvn compile

5. The class files can now be found in 

     graphvizapi/target/classes

6. Add the above to the your CLASSPATH environment variable.

     export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:..../graphvizapi/target/classes

   * replace .... with the actual path.

7. Build the graphvizJavaTest example

     javac graphvizJavaTest

8. Run it

     java graphvizJavaTest

9. Check the output
